🔍 Business Insights

Fashion is the highest revenue contributor, though margin differences across categories remain minimal (27–28%).

East region generates the highest revenue, while South demonstrates slightly stronger margin efficiency.

Mid-week performance (especially Wednesday) shows the highest revenue and AOV, driven by higher average basket size rather than increased discounting.

Revenue distribution across regions and categories remains relatively balanced, indicating diversified business performance.
